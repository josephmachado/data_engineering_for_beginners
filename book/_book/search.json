    "section": "1.3 Use SELECT…FROM, LIMIT, WHERE, & ORDER BY to read the required data",
    "text": "1.3 Use SELECT…FROM, LIMIT, WHERE, & ORDER BY to read the required data\nThe most common use for querying is to read data in our tables. We can do this using a SELECT ... FROM statement, as shown below.\n\n%%sql\n-- use * to specify all columns\nSELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  orders\nLIMIT\n  4\n\n\n%%sql\n-- use column names to only read data from those columns\nSELECT\n  o_orderkey,\n  o_totalprice\nFROM\n  orders\nLIMIT\n  4\n\nHowever, running a SELECT ... FROM statement can cause issues when the data set is extensive. If you want to look at the data, use LIMIT n to tell Trino only to get n number of rows.\nWe can use the’ WHERE’ clause if we want to get the rows that match specific criteria. We can specify one or more filters within the’ WHERE’ clause. The WHERE clause with more than one filter can use combinations of AND and OR criteria to combine the filter criteria, as shown below.\n\n%%sql\n-- all customer rows that have c_nationkey = 20\nSELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  customer\nWHERE\n  c_nationkey = 20\nLIMIT\n  10;\n\n\n%%sql\n-- all customer rows that have c_nationkey = 20 and c_acctbal &gt; 1000\nSELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  customer\nWHERE\n  c_nationkey = 20\n  AND c_acctbal &gt; 1000\nLIMIT\n  10;\n\n\n%%sql\n-- all customer rows that have c_nationkey = 20 or c_acctbal &gt; 1000\nSELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  customer\nWHERE\n  c_nationkey = 20\n  OR c_acctbal &gt; 1000\nLIMIT\n  10;\n\n\n%%sql\n-- all customer rows that have (c_nationkey = 20 and c_acctbal &gt; 1000) or rows that have c_nationkey = 11\nSELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  customer\nWHERE\n  (\n    c_nationkey = 20\n    AND c_acctbal &gt; 1000\n  )\n  OR c_nationkey = 11\nLIMIT\n  10;\n\nWe can combine multiple filter clauses, as seen above. We have seen examples of equals (=) and greater than (&gt;) conditional operators. There are 6 conditional operators, they are\n\n&lt; Less than\n&gt; Greater than\n&lt;= Less than or equal to\n&gt;= Greater than or equal to\n= Equal\n&lt;&gt; and != both represent Not equal (some DBs only support one of these)\n\nAdditionally, for string types, we can make pattern matching with like condition. In a like condition, a _ means any single character, and % means zero or more characters, for example.\n\n%%sql\n-- all customer rows where the name has a 381 in it\nSELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  customer\nWHERE\n  c_name LIKE '%381%';\n\n\n%%sql\n-- all customer rows where the name ends with a 381\nSELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  customer\nWHERE\n  c_name LIKE '%381';\n\n\n%%sql\n-- all customer rows where the name starts with a 381\nSELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  customer\nWHERE\n  c_name LIKE '381%';\n\n\n%%sql\n-- all customer rows where the name has a combination of any character and 9 and 1\nSELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  customer\nWHERE\n  c_name LIKE '%_91%';\n\nWe can also filter for more than one value using IN and NOT IN.\n\n%%sql\n-- all customer rows which have nationkey = 10 or nationkey = 20\nSELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  customer\nWHERE\n  c_nationkey IN (10, 20);\n\n\n%%sql\n-- all customer rows which have do not have nationkey as 10 or 20\nSELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  customer\nWHERE\n  c_nationkey NOT IN (10, 20);\n\nWe can get the number of rows in a table using count(*) as shown below.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT\n  COUNT(*)\nFROM\n  customer;\n\n-- 1500\n\n\n%%sql\nSELECT\n  COUNT(*)\nFROM\n  lineitem;\n\n-- 60175\n\nIf we want to get the rows sorted by values in a specific column, we use ORDER BY, for example.\n\n%%sql\n-- Will show the first ten customer records with the lowest custkey\n-- rows are ordered in ASC order by default\nSELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  orders\nORDER BY\n  o_custkey\nLIMIT\n  10;\n\n\n%%sql\n-- Will show the first ten customer's records with the highest custkey\nSELECT\n  *\nFROM\n  orders\nORDER BY\n  o_custkey DESC\nLIMIT\n  10;",

    "text": "1.4 Combine data from multiple tables using JOINs\nWe can combine data from multiple tables using joins. When we write a join query, we have a format as shown below.\nSELECT\n    a.*\nFROM\n    table_a a -- LEFT table a\n    JOIN table_b b -- RIGHT table b\n    ON a.id = b.id\nThe table specified first (table_a) is the left table, whereas the table established second is the right table. When we have multiple tables joined, we consider the joined dataset from the first two tables as the left table and the third table as the right table (The DB optimizes our join for performance).\nSELECT\n    a.*\nFROM\n    table_a a -- LEFT table a\n    JOIN table_b b -- RIGHT table b\n    ON a.id = b.id\n    JOIN table_c c -- LEFT table is the joined data from table_a & table_b, right table is table_c\n    ON a.c_id = c.id\nThere are five main types of joins, they are:\n\n1.4.1 1. Inner join (default): Get rows with same join keys from both tables\n\n%%sql\nSELECT\n  o.o_orderkey,\n  l.l_orderkey\nFROM\n  orders o\n  JOIN lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey\n  AND o.o_orderdate BETWEEN l.l_shipdate - INTERVAL '5' DAY AND l.l_shipdate  + INTERVAL '5' DAY\nLIMIT\n  10;\n\n\n%%sql\nSELECT\n  COUNT(o.o_orderkey) AS order_rows_count,\n  COUNT(l.l_orderkey) AS lineitem_rows_count\nFROM\n  orders o\n  JOIN lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey\n  AND o.o_orderdate BETWEEN l.l_shipdate - INTERVAL '5' DAY AND l.l_shipdate  + INTERVAL '5' DAY;\n-- 2477, 2477\n\nNote: JOIN defaults to INNER JOIN`.\nThe output will have rows from orders and lineitem that found at least one matching row from the other table with the specified join condition (same orderkey and orderdate within ship date +/- 5 days).\nWe can also see that 2,477 rows from orders and lineitem tables matched.\n\n\n1.4.2 2. Left outer join (aka left join): Get all rows from the left table and only matching rows from the right table.\n\n%%sql\n\nSELECT\n  o.o_orderkey,\n  l.l_orderkey\nFROM\n  orders o\n  LEFT JOIN lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey\n  AND o.o_orderdate BETWEEN l.l_shipdate - INTERVAL '5' DAY AND l.l_shipdate  + INTERVAL '5' DAY\nLIMIT\n  10;\n\n\n%%sql\nSELECT\n  COUNT(o.o_orderkey) AS order_rows_count,\n  COUNT(l.l_orderkey) AS lineitem_rows_count\nFROM\n  orders o\n  LEFT JOIN lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey\n  AND o.o_orderdate BETWEEN l.l_shipdate - INTERVAL '5' DAY AND l.l_shipdate  + INTERVAL '5' DAY;\n-- 15197, 2477\n\nThe output will have all the rows from orders and the rows from lineitem that were able to find at least one matching row from the orders table with the specified join condition (same orderkey and orderdate within ship date +/- 5 days).\nWe can also see that the number of rows from the orders table is 15,197 & from the lineitem table is 2,477. The number of rows in orders is 15000, but the join condition produces 15197 since some orders match with multiple lineitems.\n\n\n1.4.3 3. Right outer join (aka right join): Get matching rows from the left and all rows from the right table.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT\n  o.o_orderkey,\n  l.l_orderkey\nFROM\n  orders o\n  RIGHT JOIN lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey\n  AND o.o_orderdate BETWEEN l.l_shipdate - INTERVAL '5' DAY AND l.l_shipdate  + INTERVAL '5' DAY\nLIMIT\n  10;\n\n\n%%sql\nSELECT\n  COUNT(o.o_orderkey) AS order_rows_count,\n  COUNT(l.l_orderkey) AS lineitem_rows_count\nFROM\n  orders o\n  RIGHT JOIN lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey\n  AND o.o_orderdate BETWEEN l.l_shipdate - INTERVAL '5' DAY AND l.l_shipdate  + INTERVAL '5' DAY;\n-- 2477, 60175\n\nThe output will have the rows from orders that found at least one matching row from the lineitem table with the specified join condition (same orderkey and orderdate within ship date +/- 5 days) and all the rows from the lineitem table.\nWe can also see that the number of rows from the orders table is 15,197 & from the lineitem table is 2,477.\n\n\n1.4.4 4. Full outer join: Get matched and un-matched rows from both the tables.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT\n  o.o_orderkey,\n  l.l_orderkey\nFROM\n  orders o\n  FULL OUTER JOIN lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey\n  AND o.o_orderdate BETWEEN l.l_shipdate - INTERVAL '5' DAY AND l.l_shipdate  + INTERVAL '5' DAY\nLIMIT\n  10\n\n\n%%sql\nSELECT\n  COUNT(o.o_orderkey) AS order_rows_count,\n  COUNT(l.l_orderkey) AS lineitem_rows_count\nFROM\n  orders o\n  FULL OUTER JOIN lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey\n  AND o.o_orderdate BETWEEN l.l_shipdate - INTERVAL '5' DAY AND l.l_shipdate  + INTERVAL '5' DAY;\n-- 15197, 60175\n\nThe output will have all the rows from orders that found at least one matching row from the lineitem table with the specified join condition (same orderkey and orderdate within ship date +/- 5 days) and all the rows from the lineitem table.\nWe can also see that the number of rows from the orders table is 15,197 & from the lineitem table is 2,477.\n\n\n1.4.5 5. Cross join: Join every row in left table with every row in the right table\n\n%%sql\nSELECT\n  n.n_name AS nation_c_name,\n  r.r_name AS region_c_name\nFROM\n  nation n\n  CROSS JOIN region r;\n\nThe output will have every row of the nation joined with every row of the region. There are 25 nations and five regions, leading to 125 rows in our result from the cross-join.\nThere are cases where we will need to join a table with itself, called a SELF-join. Lets consider an example.\n\nFor every customer order, get the order placed earlier in the same week (Sunday - Saturday, not the previous seven days). Only show customer orders that have at least one such order.\n\n\n%%sql    \nSELECT\n    o1.o_custkey as o1_custkey,\n    o1.o_totalprice as o1_totalprice,\n    o1.o_orderdate as o1_orderdate,\n    o2.o_totalprice as o2_totalprice,\n    o2.o_orderdate as o2_orderdate\nFROM\n    orders o1\n    JOIN orders o2 ON o1.o_custkey = o2.o_custkey\n    AND year(o1.o_orderdate) = year(o2.o_orderdate)\n    AND weekofyear(o1.o_orderdate) = weekofyear(o2.o_orderdate)\nWHERE\n    o1.o_orderkey != o2.o_orderkey\nLIMIT\n    10;",

    "text": "1.9 Change data types (CAST) and handle NULLS (COALESCE)\nEvery column in a table has a specific data type. The data types fall under one of the following categories.\n\nNumerical: Data types used to store numbers.\n\nInteger: Positive and negative numbers. Different types of Integer, such as tinyint, int, and bigint, allow storage of different ranges of values. Integers cannot have decimal digits.\nFloating: These can have decimal digits but stores an approximate value.\nDecimal: These can have decimal digits and store the exact value. The decimal type allows you to specify the scale and precision. Where scale denotes the count of numbers allowed as a whole & precision denotes the count of numbers allowed after the decimal point. E.g., DECIMAL(8,3) allows eight numbers in total, with three allowed after the decimal point.\n\nBoolean: Data types used to store True or False values.\nString: Data types used to store alphanumeric characters.\n\nVarchar(n): Data type allows storage of variable character string, with a permitted max length n.\nChar(n): Data type allows storage of fixed character string. A column of char(n) type adds (length(string) - n) empty spaces to a string that does not have n characters.\n\nDate & time: Data types used to store dates, time, & timestamps(date + time).\nObjects (JSON, ARRAY): Data types used to store JSON and ARRAY data.\n\nSome databases have data types that are unique to them as well. We should check the database documents to understand the data types offered.\nFunctions such as DATE_DIFF and ROUND are specific to a data type. It is best practice to use the appropriate data type for your columns. We can convert data types using the CAST function, as shown below.\nA NULL will be used for that field when a value is not present. In cases where we want to use the first non-NULL value from a list of columns, we use COALESCE as shown below.\nLet’s consider an example as shown below. We can see how when l.orderkey is NULL; the DB uses 999999 as the output.\n\n%%sql\nSELECT\n    o.o_orderkey,\n    o.o_orderdate,\n    COALESCE(l.l_orderkey, 9999999) AS lineitem_orderkey,\n    l.l_shipdate\nFROM\n    orders o\n    LEFT JOIN lineitem l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey\n    AND o.o_orderdate BETWEEN l.l_shipdate - INTERVAL '5' DAY\n    AND l.l_shipdate + INTERVAL '5' DAY\nLIMIT\n    10;",

E.g., SELECT CONCAT(clerk, '-', orderpriority) FROM ORDERS LIMIT 5; will concatenate clear and orderpriority columns with a dash in between them.\nSPLIT is used to split a value into an array based on a given delimiter. E.g., SELECT SPLIT(clerk, '#') FROM ORDERS LIMIT 5; will output a column with arrays formed by splitting clerk values on #.\nSUBSTRING is used to get a sub-string from a value, given the start and end character indices. E.g., SELECT clerk, SUBSTR(clerk, 1, 5) FROM orders LIMIT 5; will get the first five (1 - 5) characters of the clerk column. Note that the indexing starts from 1 in Trino.\nTRIM is used to remove empty spaces to the left and right of the value. E.g., SELECT TRIM(' hi '); will output hi without any spaces around it. LTRIM and RTRIM are similar but only remove spaces before and after the string, respectively.\n\nDate and Time functions\n\nAdding and subtracting dates: Is used to add and subtract periods; the format heavily depends on the DB. E.g., In Trino, the query\n  SELECT\n  date_diff('DAY', DATE '2022-10-01', DATE '2023-11-05') diff_in_days,\n  date_diff('MONTH', DATE '2022-10-01', DATE '2023-11-05') diff_in_months,\n  date_diff('YEAR', DATE '2022-10-01', DATE '2023-11-05') diff_in_years;\nIt will show the difference between the two dates in the specified period. We can also add/subtract an arbitrary period from a date/time column. E.g., SELECT DATE '2022-11-05' + INTERVAL '10' DAY; will show the output 2022-11-15.\nstring &lt;=&gt; date/time conversions: When we want to change the data type of a string to date/time, we can use the DATE 'YYYY-MM-DD' or TIMESTAMP 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS functions. But when the data is in a different date/time format such as MM/DD/YYYY, we will need to specify the input structure; we do this using date_parse, E.g. SELECT date_parse('11-05-2023', '%m-%d-%Y');. We can convert a timestamp/date into a string with the required format using date_format. E.g., SELECT DATE_FORMAT(orderdate, '%Y-%m-01') AS first_month_date FROM orders LIMIT 5; will map every orderdate to the first of their month.\nTime frame functions (YEAR/MONTH/DAY): When we want to extract specific periods from a date/time column, we can use these functions. E.g., SELECT year(date '2023-11-05'); will return 2023. Similarly, we have month, day, hour, min, etc.\n\nNumeric\n\nROUND is used to specify the number of digits allowed after the decimal point. E.g. SELECT ROUND(100.102345, 2);",

Views are DB objects that operate similarly to a table.

Ranks the rows with the same value (defined by the “ORDER BY” clause) as the same and does not skip any ranking numbers.\nROW_NUMBER: Adds a row number that starts from 1 to n within the window frame and does not create any repeating values.\n\n\n%%sql\n-- Let's look at an example showing the difference between RANK, DENSE_RANK and ROW_NUMBER\nSELECT \n    order_date,\n    order_id,\n    total_price,\n    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY order_date ORDER BY total_price) AS row_number,\n    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY order_date ORDER BY total_price) AS rank,\n    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY order_date ORDER BY total_price) AS dense_rank\nFROM (\n    SELECT \n        '2024-07-08' AS order_date, 'order_1' AS order_id, 100 AS total_price UNION ALL\n    SELECT \n        '2024-07-08', 'order_2', 200 UNION ALL\n    SELECT \n        '2024-07-08', 'order_3', 150 UNION ALL\n    SELECT \n        '2024-07-08', 'order_4', 90 UNION ALL\n    SELECT \n        '2024-07-08', 'order_5', 100 UNION ALL\n    SELECT \n        '2024-07-08', 'order_6', 90 UNION ALL\n    SELECT \n        '2024-07-08', 'order_7', 100 UNION ALL\n    SELECT \n        '2024-07-10', 'order_8', 100 UNION ALL\n    SELECT \n        '2024-07-10', 'order_9', 100 UNION ALL\n    SELECT \n        '2024-07-10', 'order_10', 100 UNION ALL\n    SELECT \n        '2024-07-11', 'order_11', 100\n) AS orders\nORDER BY order_date, row_number;\n\nNow that we have see how to define a window function and how to use ranking and aggregation functions, let’s take it a step further by practicing value functions.\nRemember that value functions are used to access other row’s values while operating on the current row\nLet’s take a look at LEAD and LAG functions:\n\n\n\nLAG AND LEAD",
