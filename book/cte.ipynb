    "\n",
    "A CTE is a named select statement that can be reused in a single query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex SQL queries often involve multiple subqueries. Multiple sub-queries make the code hard to read. Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to make your queries readable.\n",

    "\n",
    "## How to define a CTE \n",
