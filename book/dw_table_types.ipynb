    "As we saw in the previous chapter, Kimball is by far the most commonly used, while companies don't always follow it to a T, facts and dimensions form the basis of most of the data warehouses in the wild.\n",

    "## Facts represents events that occured & dimensions the entities to which events occur to\n",
    "\n",
    "A data warehouse is a database that stores your company's historical data. The main types of tables you need to create to power analytics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **` Dimension`**: Each row in a dimension table represents a business entity that is important to the business. For example, An car parts seller's data warehouse will have a `customer` dimension table, where each row will represent an individual customer. Other examples of dimension tables in a car parts seller's data warehouse would be `supplier` & `part` tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **` Facts`**: Each row in a fact table represents a business process that occurred. E.g., In our data warehouse, each row in the `orders` fact table will represent an individual order, and each row in the `lineitem` fact table will represent an item sold as part of an order. Each fact row will have a unique identifier; in our case, it's `orderkey` for orders and a combination of `orderkey & linenumber` for lineitem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fact table's **` grain (aka granularity, level)`** refers to what a row in a fact table represents. E.g., In our checkout process, we can have two fact tables, one for the order and another for the individual items in the order. The items table will have one row per item purchased, whereas the order table will have one row per order made.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this scenario the expensive reprocessing of data can be avoided by creating an OBT. In an OBT you left join all the dimensions into a fact table. This big table can then be used to aggregate to different grains as needed for end user reproting.\n",

    "Note that the OBT should have the same grain as the fact table that it is based on or have the lower grain if you have to join multiple fact tables.\n",

    "## Summary or pre-aggregated tables are stakeholder-team specific tables built for reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders often require data aggregated at various grains and similar metrics. Creating pre-aggregated or summary tables is creating these report for stakeholders so all they would have to do is select from the table without the need to recompute metrics. This has 2 benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Same metric formula, as the data engineering will keep the metric definition in the code base, vs each stakeholder using a slightly different version and ending up with different numbers\n",
    "2. Avoid unnecessary recomputation as multiple stakeholders can now use the same table\n",
    "\n",
    "However the down side is that the data may not be as fresh as what a stakeholder would get if they just write a query.\n",
