Almost all systems these days have a Python libraries to interact with it.\n\nFor data engineering this means that one can use Python to interact with any part of the stack. Let's look at the types of systems for reading and writing and how Python is used there:\n\n1. **`Database drivers`**: These are libraries that you can use to connect to a database. Database drivers require you to use credentials to create a connection to your database. Once you have the connection object, you can run queries, read data from your database in Python, etc. Some examples are psycopg2, sqlite3, duckdb, etc.\n2. **`Cloud SDKs`**: Most cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) provide their own SDK(Software Development Kit). You can use the SDK to work with any of the cloud services. In data pipelines, you would typically use the SDK to extract/load data from/to a cloud storage system(S3, GCP Cloud store, etc). Some examples of SDK are AWS, which has boto3; GCP, which has gsutil; etc.\n3. **`APIs`**: Some systems expose data via APIs. Essentially, a server will accept an HTTPS request and return some data based on the parameters. Python has the popular `requests` library to work with APIs. \n4. **`Files`**: Python enables you to read/write data into files with standard libraries(e.g., `csv`). Python has a plethora of libraries available for specialized files like XML, xlsx, parquet, etc.\n5. **`SFTP/FTP`**: These are servers typically used to provide data to clients outside your company. Python has tools like paramiko, ftplib, etc., to access the data on these servers.\n6. **`Queuing systems`**: These are systems that queue data (e.g., Kafka, AWS Kinesis, Redpanda, etc.). Python has libraries to read data from and write data to these systems, e.g., [pykafka](https://pykafka.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), etc.\n\n\n```{python}\n#| scrolled: true\nimport requests\nurl = \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1\"\nresponse = requests.get(url)\nprint(response.json())\n```\n\n```{python}\nimport csv\n\ndata_location = \"./data/customer.csv\"\nwith open(data_location, \"r\", newline=\"\") as csvfile:\n    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile)\n    next(csvreader)  # Skip header row\n    for row in csvreader:\n        print(row)\n        break\n```\n\n```{python}\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nurl = 'https://example.com'\n\nresponse = requests.get(url)\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\nfor link in soup.find_all('a'):\n    print(link.get('href'))\n```\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\nadd: image \n\nPython has multiple libraries that enable reading from and writing to various systems.
