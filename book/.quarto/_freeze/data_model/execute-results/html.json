If your company uses a microservice architetcure this becomes impossible.\n\nAnalytical querying often require processing large amounts of data which can have a significant impact on the database performance which is usually unacceptable for production systems.\n\nProduction system ususaly only stores current state and does not store a log of changes, which is typically necessary for historical analysis\n\nMost companies produce event(click tracking, e-commerce ordering, server logs monitoring, etc ) which are usually too large to be stored and queried efficiently in a production database\n\nThese are some of the reasons you need a warehouse system to be able to analyze historical information.\n\nadd: image moving from denormalized tables to star schema to normalized tables\n\n",
