Seller will also want to analyze performance and trends to optimize their inventory. Some of the questions and feature requests may be\n\n1. Get the 10 sellers, who have sold the most items?\n2. What is the average time for an order to be fulfilled?\n3. Identify the customers who purchased the same/similar items together.\n4. Create a seller dashboard that shows the top-performing items per seller\n\nThese questions ask about things that happened in the past, require reading a large amount of data, and aggregating data to get a result. These questions can be answered by querying a data warehouse.\n\n**A data warehouse is a database that has all your company's historical data and data warehousing is the process of getting data ready for analytics**.\n\n![basic Data Warehouse](/images/what_is_data_warehouse/data_warehouse.png)\n\nThere are multiple design patterns for data warehouses, a few popular ones are\n\n1. [Dimensional modeling - Kimball](https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/dimensional-modeling-techniques/)\n2. Data vault - Linstedt\n3. [Data mart](https://www.guru99.com/data-mart-tutorial.html)\n4. Flat table\n\nKimball is by far the most commonly used, while companies don't always follow it to a T, facts and dimensions form the basis of most of the data warehouses in the wild.\n\n## OLTP vs OLAP based data warehouses\n\nThere are two main types of databases: OLTP and OLAP. Their differences are shown below.\n\n|                  |                                      OLTP                                       |                                                                                            OLAP                                                                                             |\n| :--------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|    Stands for    |                          Online transaction processing                          |                                                                                Online analytical processing                                                                                 |\n|  Usage pattern   | Optimized for fast CRUD(create, read, update, delete) of a small number of rows | Optimized for running `select c1, c2, sum(c3),.. where .. group by` on a large number of rows (aka analytical queries), and ingesting large amounts of data via bulk import or event stream |\n|   Storage type   |                                  Row oriented                                   |                                                                                       Column-oriented                                                                                       |\n|  Data modeling   |                     Data modeling is based on normalization                     |                                            Data modeling is based on denormalization.

Let's consider a table `items`, with the data shown below.\n\n| item_id | item_name | item_type | item_price |   datetime_created    |   datetime_updated    |\n| :-----: | :-------: | :-------: | :--------: | :-------------------: | :-------------------: |\n|    1    |  item_1   |  gaming   |     10     | '2021-10-02 00:00:00' | '2021-11-02 13:00:00' |\n|    2    |  item_2   |  gaming   |     20     | '2021-10-02 01:00:00' | '2021-11-02 14:00:00' |\n|    3    |  item_3   |  biking   |     30     | '2021-10-02 02:00:00' | '2021-11-02 15:00:00' |\n|    4    |  item_4   |  surfing  |     40     | '2021-10-02 03:00:00' | '2021-11-02 16:00:00' |\n|    5    |  item_5   |  biking   |     50     | '2021-10-02 04:00:00' | '2021-11-02 17:00:00' |\n\nLet's see how this table will be stored in a row and column-oriented storage. Data is stored as continuous pages (group of records) on the disk.\n\n**Row oriented storage:**\n\nLet's assume that there is one row per page.\n\n```bash\nPage 1: [1,item_1,gaming,10,'2021-10-02 00:00:00','2021-11-02 13:00:00'],\nPage 2: [2,item_2,gaming,20,'2021-10-02 01:00:00','2021-11-02 14:00:00']\nPage 3: [3,item_3,biking,30, '2021-10-02 02:00:00','2021-11-02 15:00:00'],\nPage 4: [4,item_4,surfing,40, '2021-10-02 03:00:00','2021-11-02 16:00:00'],\nPage 5: [5,item_5,biking,50, '2021-10-02 04:00:00','2021-11-02 17:00:00']\n```\n\n**Column-oriented storage:**\n\nLet's assume that there is one column per page.\n\n```bash\nPage 1: [1,2,3,4,5],\nPage 2: [item_1,item_2,item_3,item_4,item_5],\nPage 3: [gaming,gaming,biking,surfing,biking],\nPage 4: [10,20,30,40,50],\nPage 5: ['2021-10-02 00:00:00','2021-10-02 01:00:00','2021-10-02 02:00:00','2021-10-02 03:00:00','2021-10-02 04:00:00'],\nPage 6: ['2021-11-02 13:00:00','2021-11-02 14:00:00','2021-11-02 15:00:00','2021-11-02 16:00:00','2021-11-02 17:00:00']\n```\n\nLet's see how a simple analytical query will be executed.\n\n```sql\nSELECT item_type,\n    SUM(price) total_price\nFROM items\nGROUP BY item_type;\n```\n\nIn a **row-oriented database**\n\n1. All the pages will need to be loaded into memory\n2. Sum `price` column for same `item_type` values\n\nIn a **column-oriented database**\n\n1. Only pages 3 and 4 will need to be loaded into memory. The information mapping page 3 and 4 to item_type and total_price will be encoded in the column oriented file and also stored in an OLTP called metadata db.\n2. Sum `price` column for same `item_type` values\n\nAs you can see from this approach, we only need to read 2 pages in a column-oriented database vs 5 pages in a row-oriented database. In addition to this, a column-oriented database also provides\n\n1. Better compression, as similar data types are next to each other and can be compressed more efficiently.\n2. [Vectorized processing](https://binaryterms.com/vector-processing.html)\n\nAll of these features make a column-oriented database a great choice for storing and analyzing large amounts of data.\n\n",
