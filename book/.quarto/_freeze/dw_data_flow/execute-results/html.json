Most industry-standard patterns follow a 3-hop (or layered) architecture. They are \n\n1. **Raw layer** stores data from upstream sources as is. This layer sometimes involves changing data types and standardizing column names.\n2. **Transformed layer**: Data from the raw layer is transformed based on a chosen modeling principle to form a set of tables. Common modeling principles are Dimensional modeling (Kimball), Data Vault model, entity-relationship data model, etc.\n3. **Consumption layer**: Data from the transformed layer are combined to form datasets that directly map to the end-user use case. The consumption layer typically involves joining and aggregating transformed layer tables to enable end-users to analyze historical performance. **Business-specific metrics** are often defined at this layer.  We should ensure that **a  metric is only defined in one place**.\n4. **Interface layer [Optional]**: Data in the consumption layer often confirms the data warehouse naming/data types, etc. However, the data presented to the end user should be easy to use and understand. An interface layer is often a **view** that acts as an interface between the warehouse table and the consumers of this table.\n\nMost frameworks/tools propose their version of the 3-hop architecture: \n1. [Apache Spark: Medallion architecture](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture)\n2. [dbt: Project Structure](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview).\n\nShown below is our project's 3-hop architecture:\n\n![Data architecture](/images/de_best_practices/data_flow.png)\n\nThe bronze, silver, gold, and interface layers correspond to the abovementioned raw, transformed, consumption, and interface layers. We have used **[dimensional modeling]({{< ref \"/post/what-is-a-data-warehouse.md#3-what-is-a-data-warehouse\" >}})** (with **[SCD2]({{< ref \"/post/how-to-join-fact-scd2-tables.md#what-is-an-scd2-table-and-why-use-it\" >}})** for dim_customers) for our silver layer. \n\nFor a pipeline/transformation function/table, inputs are called **upstream**, and output users are called **downstream** consumers.\n\nAt larger companies, multiple teams work on different layers. A data ingestion team may bring the data into the bronze layer, and other teams may build their own silver and gold tables as necessary.\n\n",
