    "In the previous chapters we learn't how to manipulate data with Spark SQL, how to create pipeline transformations with dbt and how to schedule  & orchestrate them with Airflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this capstone project we will put them together to create an end-to-end project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objectives for this capstone project are\n",
    "1. Understanding how the different components common in data engineering work with each other\n",
    "2. How to model and transform data in the 3-hop architecture\n",
    "3. Clearly explain what your pipeline is doing and why and how\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that we are working on modeling the TPCH data and creating a data mart for sales team to create customer metrics which they can use to strategize how to cold call customers.\n",

    "When a hiring manager looks at your project, assume that they will not read over the code. Typically when people look at projects they browse high level sections, these includes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Outcome of your project\n",
    "2. High level architecture\n",
    "3. Project structure to understand how your code works\n",
    "4. Browse code for clarity and code-cleanliness\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how you can address these \n",
    "\n",
    "## Start with the outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "We are creating data for the sales team to enable customer outreach and for this we need to present customers who will most likely convert. While this is a complex data science question, a simple approach could be to target customers who have the highest average order value (assuming high/low order values are outliers).\n",

    "Create a dashboard to show the top 10 customers by average order values as a descending bar chart.\n",

    "1. Designing data pipelines, by following industry standard 3-hop architecture\n",
    "2. Industry standard tools like dbt, Airflow and Spark\n",
    "3. Writing clean code using auto formatters and linters\n",
    "\n",
    "Our base repo comes with all of these setup and installed for you to copy over and use. \n",
    "\n",
    "add: 3-hop dbt folder structure\n",

    "## Code explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "We have code that does the following \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use dbt to define Spark SQL pipelines following the 3-hop architecture that we saw in the dbt chapter. Add: folder structure screenshot\n",
    "2. Use Airflow to load data into the warehouse and run dbt pipeline on a schedule and be able to monitor it  add; dag screenshot\n",
    "3. Follow Kimball dimensional modeling for our dbt pipeline, add: 3-hop arch\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find a dataset that you are interested in, showing an interesting take for the data. Outcome should be shown with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can copy paste the `airflow` folder into a separate folder and make the necessary changes. You can add requirements to the requirements.txt file \n",
