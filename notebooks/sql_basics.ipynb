    "## Change data types (CAST) and handle NULLS (COALESCE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every column in a table has a specific data type. The data types fall under one of the following categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`Numerical`**: Data types used to store numbers.\n",
    "   1. Integer: Positive and negative numbers. Different types of Integer, such as tinyint, int, and bigint, allow storage of different ranges of values. Integers cannot have decimal digits.\n",
    "   2. Floating: These can have decimal digits but stores an approximate value.\n",
    "   3. Decimal: These can have decimal digits and store the exact value. The decimal type allows you to specify the scale and precision. Where scale denotes the count of numbers allowed as a whole & precision denotes the count of numbers allowed after the decimal point. E.g., DECIMAL(8,3) allows eight numbers in total, with three allowed after the decimal point.\n",
    "2. **`Boolean`**: Data types used to store True or False values.\n",
    "3. **` String`**: Data types used to store alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "   1. Varchar(n): Data type allows storage of variable character string, with a permitted max length n.\n",
    "   2. Char(n): Data type allows storage of fixed character string. A column of char(n) type adds (length(string) - n) empty spaces to a string that does not have n characters.\n",
    "4. **`Date & time`**: Data types used to store dates, time, & timestamps(date + time).\n",
    "5. **` Objects (JSON, ARRAY)`**: Data types used to store JSON and ARRAY data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some databases have data types that are unique to them as well. We should check the database documents to understand the data types offered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions such as `DATE_DIFF` and `ROUND` are specific to a data type. It is best practice to use the appropriate data type for your columns. We can convert data types using the `CAST` function, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",

    "USE tpch.tiny;\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT\n",

    "```\n",
    "## Use these standard inbuilt DB functions for String, Time, and Numeric data manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "When processing data, more often than not, we will need to change values in columns; shown below are a few standard functions to be aware of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **` String functions`**\n",
    "   1. **LENGTH** is used to calculate the length of a string. E.g., `SELECT LENGTH('hi');` will output 2.\n",
    "   2. **CONCAT** combines multiple string columns into one. E.g., `SELECT CONCAT(clerk, '-', orderpriority) FROM ORDERS LIMIT 5;` will concatenate clear and orderpriority columns with a dash in between them.\n",
    "   3. **SPLIT** is used to split a value into an array based on a given delimiter. E.g., `SELECT SPLIT(clerk, '#') FROM ORDERS LIMIT 5;` will output a column with arrays formed by splitting clerk values on `#`.\n",
    "   4. **SUBSTRING** is used to get a sub-string from a value, given the start and end character indices. E.g., `SELECT clerk, SUBSTR(clerk, 1, 5) FROM orders LIMIT 5;` will get the first five (1 - 5) characters of the clerk column. Note that the indexing starts from 1 in Trino.\n",
    "   5. **TRIM** is used to remove empty spaces to the left and right of the value. E.g., `SELECT TRIM(' hi ');` will output `hi` without any spaces around it. LTRIM and RTRIM are similar but only remove spaces before and after the string, respectively.\n",
    "2. **` Date and Time functions`**\n",
    "   1. **Adding and subtracting dates**: Is used to add and subtract periods; the format heavily depends on the DB. E.g., In Trino, the query\n",
    "      ```sql\n",
    "        SELECT\n",
    "        date_diff('DAY', DATE '2022-10-01', DATE '2023-11-05') diff_in_days,\n",
    "        date_diff('MONTH', DATE '2022-10-01', DATE '2023-11-05') diff_in_months,\n",
    "        date_diff('YEAR', DATE '2022-10-01', DATE '2023-11-05') diff_in_years;\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    It will show the difference between the two dates in the specified period. We can also add/subtract an arbitrary period from a date/time column. E.g., `SELECT DATE '2022-11-05' + INTERVAL '10' DAY;` will show the output `2022-11-15`.\n",
    "   2. **string <=> date/time conversions**: When we want to change the data type of a string to date/time, we can use the `DATE 'YYYY-MM-DD'` or `TIMESTAMP 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS` functions. But when the data is in a different date/time format such as `MM/DD/YYYY`, we will need to specify the input structure; we do this using `date_parse,` E.g. `SELECT date_parse('11-05-2023', '%m-%d-%Y');`. We can convert a timestamp/date into a string with the required format using `date_format`. E.g., `SELECT DATE_FORMAT(orderdate, '%Y-%m-01') AS first_month_date FROM orders LIMIT 5;` will map every orderdate to the first of their month.\n",
    "   3. **Time frame functions (YEAR/MONTH/DAY)**:  When we want to extract specific periods from a date/time column, we can use these functions. E.g., `SELECT year(date '2023-11-05');` will return 2023. Similarly, we have month, day, hour, min, etc.\n",
    "3. **`Numeric`**\n",
    "   1. **ROUND** is used to specify the number of digits allowed after the decimal point. E.g. `SELECT ROUND(100.102345, 2);`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Save queries as views for more straightforward reads\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have large/complex queries that we need to run often, we can save them as views. Views are DB objects that operate similarly to a table. The OLAP DB executes the underlying query when we query a view. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use views to hide query complexities and limit column access (by exposing only specific table columns) for end-users.\n",
