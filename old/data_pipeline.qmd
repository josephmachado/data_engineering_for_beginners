# Scheduler defines when & Orchestrator defines how to, run your data pipelines

Schedulers define when to start your data pipeline, e.g. cron, Airflow, etc.

Orchestrators defines the order in which the tasks of a data pipeline should run. For example extract before transform, complex branching logic, excuting across multiple systems such as spark and snowflake, etc. E.g., dbt-core, Airflow, etc
